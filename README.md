## Code is in working mode but before downloading you will have to need some files.

### 1. Paytm Sandbox credential [Visit paytm website](https://business.paytm.com/payments)

### 2. Paytm App checksum kit [visit paytm github repositry](https://github.com/Paytm-Payments/Paytm_App_Checksum_Kit_PHP)
    Download that code and go into ConfigChecksum.php file and change Merchant Key
