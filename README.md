# PaytmPaymentApp

## Code is in working mode but before download you have to need some file

### 1. Paytm Sandbox credential [Visit paytm website](https://business.paytm.com/payments)

### 2. Paytm App checksum kit [visit paytm github repositry](https://github.com/Paytm-Payments/Paytm_App_Checksum_Kit_PHP)
    Download that code and go into ConfigChecksum.php file and change Merchant Key    

### 3. Paytm PGSDK file . that is already in project so don't worry about it.

## Before run Check Constants file in project

Now you can easily run your project but if any case you have any issues you can ask to me.
